%[70-100\%] A submission in this mark band will consist of an application which has extended the lab work covered in class to offer an excellent level of functionality and which has been evaluated effectively against apps available on, for example, Google Play. You will have implemented more advanced features or have used components, widgets and APIs that have not been specifically covered in the practical sessions and which you have investigated yourself. Your design and code will be excellent â€“ making good use of classes & methods and well documented. Your report with the sections detailed above will be comprehensive, very well written and well presented and will correctly reference all the material you have used. This is likely to include textbooks, online forums and tutorials and some of the suggested reading for the module.

%[60-69\%] To achieve a mark in this band you will have developed an app with very good functionality, offering the user multiple activities to provide an engaging app. Your app should feature multiple activities and support appropriate user interaction. It should demonstrate basic I/O principles, such as the use of buttons, images, text input and/or spinners commensurate with your idea and design. Your report will address all the necessary sections effectively, be very well written and clearly presented and will reference material you have used.

%[50-59\%] A submission graded into this mark band will indicate that you have developed an app that is less ambitious in its functionality but will offer the user suitable ways of interacting. Your report will be well written and will reference the material you have used.

%[40-49\%] To achieve a mark in this band you must have developed your own working app with multiple activities allowing the user some interaction. The basic usability requirement is that other users (aside from yourself) must be able to use your prototype at least to a basic level.. It may be based on an extension of the practical work covered in class and your report must adequately describe your work.
