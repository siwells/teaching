%[70-100\%] A submission in this mark band will demonstrate that you have gone beyond the core learning for the module and have actively pursued your own learning path. Your submission will include a site that goes beyond the core techniques discussed in class and lab sessions and that offers an excellent level of functionality with rewarding user experience. You will have evaluated your design using appropriate techniques. You will have implemented more advanced features that have not been specifically covered in the practical sessions and which you will have investigated for yourself. Your design and code will be excellent. All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be well organised. Your report will be comprehensive, very well written and presented, and will correctly reference all the material you have used. This is likely to include textbooks, online forums and tutorials and some of the suggested reading for the module.

%[60-69\%] To achieve a mark in this band you will have developed a site with very good functionality, offering the user multiple ciphers to discover. You may have chosen more complex ciphers to implement, or might have implemented ciphers that require additional keys. Your site will have a pleasing design, making very good use of appropriately selected HTML, CSS, Javascript features in order to provide a pleasing user experience. Your report will address all the necessary sections effectively, be very well written, clearly presented, and will reference all materials you have used.  

%[50-59\%] A submission graded into this mark band will indicate that you have developed a site that is less ambitious in its functionality. You will have implemented at least two ciphers and your site will enable users to both encipher and decipher messages. Your site will have solid design and provide an acceptable user experience. Your report will be well written and will reference the material you have used.

%[40-49\%] To achieve a mark in this band you must have developed your own set of HTML web-pages with associated CSS and Javascript as appropriate. Your user must be able to navigate between your pages. You will have implemented pages for two ciphers. Your cipher pages will encipher a supplied message. Your design will be rudimetrary but a basic usability requirement is that other users (aside from yourself) must be able to navigate your web-site. A submission in the grade band may be based on an extension of the practical work covered in class. Your report will adequately describe your work.
